# **Hyperspectral Image Processing**

A comprehensive collection of Jupyter notebooks and tools for analyzing and processing hyperspectral imagery (HSI) data, covering both fundamental operations and advanced machine learning techniques.

## 📋 Overview

This repository contains practical implementations and examples for:

### Basic HSI Operations
1. Reading and loading hyperspectral image data
2. Visualizing spectral signatures of pixels
3. Implementing thresholds, segmentation, and masking techniques
4. Image manipulation (cutting, merging, and mosaicing)

### Advanced Analysis
5. Machine Learning & Deep Learning Applications
   - Classification models
   - Regression analysis
   - Dimensionality reduction
   - NDSI

6. Feature Engineering
   - Band selection methods
   - Feature extraction techniques
   - Spectral indices calculation
   - Dimensionality reduction approaches (PCA, t-SNE, etc.)
